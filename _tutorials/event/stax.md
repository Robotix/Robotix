#### Line Following

##### 1.IR LED Pair
**Working**- IR sensor or an Infrared sensor consist an IR LED coupled with a Photodiode. This pair is generally called an IR pair or Photocoupler. It works on the principle that an infrared sensor emits Infrared radiations and the Photodiode senses the same. Photodiode resistance changes according to the amount of IR radiation falling on it, hence changing the voltage drop against it. Further, by using the voltage comparator (like LM358) we can sense the voltage change and generate the output accordingly.

**Usage** - To follow a line, we can use the difference in reflectivity of the line and surface.

**Pseudo Code:**

{% highlight cpp %}
while(all ir pairs donâ€™t give high value)
{
	if (IR pair gives high value)

		{

			turn in the direction to stop receiving high value

		}

}	
{% endhighlight %}

##### 2.IR Sensor Array

For better accuracy we can use multiple IR LED pair in an IR sensor array.

**Colour Detection**

Refer to the [colour detection tutorial](https://www.robotix.in/tutorial/auto/Color_Detection/).
