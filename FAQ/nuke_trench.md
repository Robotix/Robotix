**Q: How do I register for the event? Is there any abstract submission for the event?**

Registration for the events has to be done from www.ktj.in. No abstract submission is required.


**Q: What is the participation fee for the event?**

There is no separate participation fees. But you need to pay for the accommodation. For more details regarding this, please visit www.ktj.in.


**Q: How many members can be there in a team and how many team members can control the bot during the run??**

There can be a maximum of 4 members in a team and only one member can hold the wires used for powering the bot during the run.


**Q: What kind of controller can be used?**

Any wired or wireless controller can be used.

 
**Q: What kind of micro controller can be used in the robot?**

Any micro-controller below 16 bit can be used.


**Q: Is using custom circuits allowed?**

Yes, you can use your own circuits.


**Q: What is the hybrid sensor used ?**

It consists of a metal detector, ferromagnetic detector(solenoid/electromagnet based) and along with these two sensor one needs to incorporate a sensor which will detect the presence of the block and activate metal detection and ferromagnetic detection.


**Q: Out of which material can the bot be made?**

Materials such as wood, PLA(3d printed parts), aluminium etc can be used.


**Q: Out of which material will the block handle be made?**

The block handle will be made of aluminium.


**Q: Which micro-controller is recommended?**

Arduino Uno is recommended


**Q: What will be the dimensions of the blocks?**

Size of blocks will be 6cm x 6cm x 6cm.


**Q: Can the bot be connected to a laptop during the run?**

No. Laptop can be run only to burn the code prior to the run.


**Q. What will be the colour of  the blocks?**

Blocks will be prominently bright color


**Q: After timeout what will be the orientation of the robot?**

It will be the same as the position and orientation of the robot before the timeout. The final decision rests with Team Robotix.


**Q: Are there any arrangements for the calibration of the sensors prior to the event?**

A sample arena with sample blocks and code strips for calibration will be available to the participants throughout the fest. Participants will not be allowed to test their bots on the main arena.


**Q: How to display the property of the block and the code readings?**

3 LEDs (2 on either sides and one at front of the robot) can be used to display the data. Antiparallel, parallel, continuous glowing patterns shall depict Metal, Non-metal, Ferromagnetic metal respectively, this can be done using the two on the sides of the bot. Moreover to show the directions read by code viz left, right and continue shall correspond to left, right, and front LEDs.
