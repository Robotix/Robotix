#### Problem Statement

To build a manually controlled robot that can lift itself up vertically, initiate and continue translation on an elevated surface and also pick and place objects.

#### USP

* Mechanism to switch surface plane of movement

* Picking and placing

#### Rules and Specifications

##### General Rules

1. All arena dimensions may have a tolerance (error) of up to 10%.

2. Each team can consist of a maximum of 4 members.

3. Only **2** members per team will be allowed to control the robot.

4. The participants will be provided with 220 volts, 50 Hz standard AC supply. However, the participants cannot use this voltage apart from getting a 24V DC output through an adapter. This goes to say that no component on the robot may use a power supply higher than 24V DC. In case of any discrepancy, Team ROBOTIX will have the final say.

5. Skipping any part of the arena will be the participants choice and will be done only on the participant’s request and the approval of Team ROBOTIX. Any discrepancies will be handled by Team ROBOTIX and their decision will be final and binding. The timer will not stop when the position of the robot is being changed by the participant, but the initial and final position will be decided by Team ROBOTIX.Also, if the participants choose to skip any part of the arena, no time bonus will be given to the team even if they complete the run before the timer runs out.

6. Two teams can have one or more members in common.

7. The team members can be from different institutes or colleges.

8. Teams qualifying the first round will go into the second round.

9. The teams cannot touch their robot during the course of the run, unless timeout is taken.

10. The best spirit of sportsmanship is expected from the participants.

11. **The decision of Team ROBOTIX will be final and binding.**

##### Arena and Locomotion

* The robot has to start from the **start point** (green colored area), which will be marked in the arena.

* The robot has to go and complete the tasks as specified above. Any discrepancies will be handled by Team ROBOTIX and their decision will be final and binding.

* Time will be kept by Team ROBOTIX and their decision will be final and binding.

##### Initial Orientation of Robot

* The participant is allowed to decide the initial orientation of his robot in the start zone.

* Team ROBOTIX reserves the right to disallow any initial orientation of the robot inside the starting zone if it gives the participant an undue advantage, solely based on the judge’s discretion.

##### Restarts and Timeouts

* A maximum of **2 Timeouts** of **1 minute** each may be taken in **each round**. Penalty will be awarded for each timeout and robot will start from its **last position** on the arena.

* The participant's robots can have a **maximum of 1 restart per round**. A penalty will be imposed on the team for every restart that they take.

* After the restart, the participant's robot will be set to its initial position. Timer will be set to zero and the run will start afresh with the addition of the penalty for restart.

* A timeout can be taken anytime at the participant's discretion.

* A **restart can only be taken if there is a genuine technical fault** in the robot. Team ROBOTIX may refuse a restart if the reason is not genuine enough, and their decision will be binding and final.

##### Robot Specifications

* Each robot can have a maximum dimension of 30 x 30 x 40 cubic cm (L x B x H) respectively in its most concise form, with an allowance of an extra 5%.

* No part/mechanism of/on the robot should exceed the given dimensions before the commencement of the event run. The robots can exceed their respective dimensions once the event commences. However, Team ROBOTIX gets the final say in deciding whether the advantage is fair or not.

* There is no weight restriction on the robot.

* [LEGO kits](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lego_Mindstorms) or its spare parts or pre-made mechanical parts are **not** allowed.

* Ready-made gearboxes, sensors, development boards can be used but no other part of the robot should contain any ready-made components. Simple car bases with no extra features may be used.

* The bots should not damage the event arena in any way. If it does so, a penalty will be imposed on the team. The magnitude of the penalty will be decided by Team ROBOTIX.

#### Task

##### Arena for Round 1 (Top View)

##### Round 1

* The time limit for this round is 4 minutes.

* The bot has to start from the starting area (green colored area in the arena diagram).

* The bot has to climb the stage (marked blue in the diagram on the left) near it and rotate the flagpole-shaped obstacle (using its extendable gripper) obstructing the path of the ball to clear the path. The cleared path will allow for the motion of a white ball in round 2.

![](/img/event/crescendo/manual2.jpg){:.img-responsive}
![](/img/event/crescendo/manual3.jpg){:.img-responsive}

* The bot then has to get inside the pit (shown as the blue region below) and pick up the green trapezoidal blocks one by one and has to place the green trapezoidal blocks one by one so as to fill up the 5 cm gap on the path to the stage (as shown by the gap in the ramped path below).

![](/img/event/crescendo/manual4.jpg){:.img-responsive}
![](/img/event/crescendo/manual5.png){:.img-responsive}

* The bot will also have to get the green blocks out of the cave which is blocked by a giant blue door. The door must be opened by going up the ramp to the top of the platform over the blue door and then moving the door aside.

![](/img/event/crescendo/manual6.png){:.img-responsive}
![](/img/event/crescendo/manual7.png){:.img-responsive}

* After all the green blocks are out in the pit and the gap is filled adequately, the bot has to climb the first stage and traverse the filled gap to reach the upcoming stage. 

* In this way, the bot has to come out of the pit using the stages provided to it.

![](/img/event/crescendo/manual9.png){:.img-responsive}

* Thus the First Round will end when the bot reaches the checked surface which is right outside the pit.

##### Arena for Round 2 

Same as Round 1

##### Round 2

* The time for this round is 6 minutes.

* The bot has to start from the end of the First Round (The checked surface).

* It then has to traverse along the wooden path, climbing down and then up again so that it arrives at the elevated platform next to the white ball. The bot is expected to switch its plane of operation using a suitable mechanism.

![](/img/event/crescendo/manual10.png){:.img-responsive}

* The bot then has to pick up the ball and then drop it on the tilted surface beside it the initiating the journey of the ball.

![](/img/event/crescendo/manual11.png){:.img-responsive}

* The bot will then have to traverse along the path so as to reach a green block with a cuboidal extruded protrusion.

![](/img/event/crescendo/manual12.png){:.img-responsive}
![](/img/event/crescendo/manual13.png){:.img-responsive}

* The bot will have to grip the block and place it on the surface beside it such that the extruded protrusion faces the white ball present on that surface. Then bot needs to push the block with the extended gripper so that the white ball travels down through the pipe thus removing the obstacle out of its way.

* Then further traversing along the path the bot needs to climb down the stage. After that, there is a red cube on a small podium which the bot needs to pick up drop it at the next off on the next podium under the next stage.

![](/img/event/crescendo/manual14.png){:.img-responsive}

* Further, the bot needs to get the yellow block down into the cubical vessel of the seesaw so as to lift up the obstacle on the path of the white ball which was initiated at the beginning of the Second Round.

* Thus, when the white ball reaches the checked area, it signs off the completion of the Second Round.
